The quickest reliable way to get your Vite+React+TS+Tailwind site live on GitHub Pages is to (A) ensure the app is built in CI and (B) publish the built dist/ folder (not raw source). I can't push changes to your repo right now because I don't have write access — if you want I can create the commits for you after you grant permission, or you can paste the files below and commit them yourself.

Follow these steps (Hindi) — I'll give exact files to add and exact commands.

1. What to add (files)



Update vite.config.ts so base is correct for GitHub Actions (uses repo name in CI) and "/" locally.

Add a GitHub Actions Pages workflow that runs npm ci, npm run build, copies index.html → 404.html, and publishes dist/.


vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from "vite";  
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";  
import path from "path";  
import { componentTagger } from "lovable-tagger";  
  
// If running in GitHub Actions, GITHUB_REPOSITORY looks like "owner/repo"  
const repoName = process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY?.split("/")[1] ?? "election-central";  
const isCI = process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS === "true";  
  
export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({  
  // Use repo base on CI/production so asset URLs become "/election-central/..."  
  base: isCI || mode === "production" ? `/${repoName}/` : "/",  
  server: {  
    host: "::",  
    port: 8080,  
  },  
  plugins: [react(), mode === "development" && componentTagger()].filter(Boolean),  
  resolve: {  
    alias: {  
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),  
    },  
  },  
}));

.github/workflows/pages.yml

name: Deploy to GitHub Pages  
  
on:  
  push:  
    branches: [ main ] # change if your default branch is different  
  
permissions:  
  contents: read  
  pages: write  
  id-token: write  
  
jobs:  
  build:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
      - name: Checkout repository  
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  
  
      - name: Setup Node.js  
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4  
        with:  
          node-version: 18  
          cache: 'npm'  
  
      - name: Install dependencies  
        run: npm ci  
  
      - name: Build  
        run: npm run build  
  
      - name: Add SPA fallback (copy index.html to 404.html)  
        run: |  
          if [ -d "./dist" ]; then  
            cp ./dist/index.html ./dist/404.html || true  
          fi  
  
      - name: Upload artifact for Pages  
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1  
        with:  
          path: ./dist  
  
  deploy:  
    needs: build  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    permissions:  
      pages: write  
    steps:  
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages  
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1

Optional: package.json scripts (if you don't already have them)

{  
  "scripts": {  
    "dev": "vite",  
    "build": "vite build",  
    "preview": "vite preview"  
  }  
}

2. How to commit these changes (commands)



If you want to do it yourself locally:

Save the two files above in your repo (replace existing vite.config.ts).

Commit and push to main:

git add vite.config.ts .github/workflows/pages.yml

git commit -m "chore: add pages workflow and set vite base for GH Pages"

git push origin main




3. What happens after push



GitHub Actions will run the workflow:

npm ci

npm run build → produces dist/

copies index.html to 404.html

deploys dist/ to GitHub Pages using the official Pages actions


GitHub Pages will serve the built static files (no raw TSX/TS).


4. Quick local verification (before pushing)



npm ci

npm run build

npm run preview   # or npx serve dist
Open the preview URL to confirm the production build works locally.


5. Alternative quick-and-dirty (if you want to avoid Actions)



Build locally and push dist to a branch named gh-pages and configure Pages to use that branch (not recommended long-term).

npm run build

npx gh-pages -d dist   # requires adding gh-pages package and a deploy script

Or manually copy dist contents to a gh-pages branch and force push (risky).



6. Common gotchas / troubleshooting



Blank white screen → open DevTools on deployed site:

Look for 404s for JS/CSS. If paths start without /<repo>/ then base is wrong.


Ensure Pages in repository Settings shows deployment from "GitHub Actions" (the new Pages flow) after workflow succeeds.

If you use a custom domain, set base to "/" and configure the CNAME appropriately.

If you used "Static site" earlier and GitHub created a workflow that uploaded the repo root, remove that workflow (or update it) so it no longer serves raw source.


7. I can't push these changes for you right now



I don't currently have permission to create commits in your repo. If you want me to create the commit/PR for you, grant repository permission/authorize (or provide me with a fork/branch target) and confirm — then I can prepare the PR. Otherwise, paste the two files into your repo and push them; the workflow will run automatically.


If you want, I can:

Give a single copy-paste bundle (zipped content) — or

Create a PR for you (I need push/PR permission) — or

Walk you through pushing step-by-step while you run commands.
