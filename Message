I have a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind project generated by Lovable.
The app works locally in dev mode, but after deploying to GitHub Pages it shows a blank white screen.

What I did initially (likely mistakes):
1. I selected "Static site" while setting up GitHub Pages.
2. GitHub generated a default workflow that uploads the entire repository:
   path: '.'
3. That workflow did NOT run `npm install` or `npm run build`.
4. As a result, raw source files (tsx, ts, config files) were deployed.

Current project structure:
- Vite + React (SWC)
- main.tsx
- vite.config.ts
- Tailwind config
- dist/ folder is generated locally via `npm run build`

Current vite.config.ts:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import path from "path";
import { componentTagger } from "lovable-tagger";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  base: "/<REPO_NAME>/",
  server: {
    host: "::",
    port: 8080,
  },
  plugins: [react(), mode === "development" && componentTagger()].filter(Boolean),
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
}));
